# Implementaion-Using-Pytorch
ANN-Using-Pytorch : Here I have implemented an ANN model using pytorch for predicting if a patient is Diabetic or non-Diabetic.
    Here, every cell has its own meaning and full fledged work has been done.
    Steps are followed in the attached notebook : 
        1. Import Dependencies
        2. Load the dataset.
        3. Check for null values.
        4. Define a Model class and respective method.
            Forward Propagation and Backward Propagation has been followed
        5. Checking the result on test dataset and accuracy.
        6. Save the Model
        7. Load the Model
        8. Predicting from the new-data point.
